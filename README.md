# Neighborhood-Map

date: 6/10/2015

Neighborhood-Map is the 5th project of Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree of Udacity. In this project I used the framework knockout.js to build a single page application. It shows some parks in Nottingham city (UK), the user can search a park in the list or use the map(Google Maps API) to select it. A selected park will show the nearest Restaurants to it (foursquare API).
